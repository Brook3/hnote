# 1. 常见问题
## 1.1. 多版本使用报错
使用的时候 PHP 和 composer 的路径都带上
```shell
/usr/local/php7.2/bin/php composer require topthink/think-swoole=2.0.*
```
否则会报错：
```shell
[root@iZuf6fatrpy177h9p2q53lZ php]# composer require topthink/think-swoole=2.0.*
./composer.json has been updated

  To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - /usr/local/php/etc/php.ini
  You can also run `php --ini` inside terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json to its original content.

## 1.2. proc_get_status
报错信息：
```shell

解决：
修改php.ini，将 disable_functions 中的 proc_get_status 删掉
